# MY GOAL SQUAD

This is a final year project for our Bachelors in Computer Science at RMIT
Our client reached out and requested that we create an application to upgrade the user experience of their patreons.

After brainstorming, our team came to a conclusion to tackle this task by building a progressive web application. The reasoning behind the solution was that we did not need a dedicated IOS/Android/Web client to display simple datasheets. Furthermore, it would be less time consuming to create one application that works on all devices as well.

We utilised Google's Firebase and Firestore primarily to host our projects and manage data entries and storage. Authentication and admin rights was handled using Firebase Authentication. Other side-features includes a journal and a daily motivational quote.
